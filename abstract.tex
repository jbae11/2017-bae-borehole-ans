This work evaluates a potential solution for two pressing matters in the viability of
nuclear energy: spent fuel disposal and power plants that no longer operate. The 
potential benefits of siting a borehole repository at a shut down nuclear power 
plant facility are analyzed from the perspective of myriad stakeholders. 
This assessment indicates that integrated siting will make economic 
use of the shut down power plant, take advantage of spent fuel handling 
infrastructure at those sites, minimize transportation costs, expedite emptying 
the crowded spent fuel storage pools accross the country, and will do so at 
sites more likely to have consenting communities.
