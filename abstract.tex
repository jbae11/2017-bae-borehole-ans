	This paper is a summary of a longer paper accepted for \gls{IHLRWM}.
	This paper provides a creative solution for the two issues in the U.S.
	nuclear power : retiring reactors and overflowing \gls{SNF}. The benefits
	of siting a borehole repository at a shutdown power plant is quantified
	with plausible metrics in the perspective of various stakeholders.
	The proposal demonstrates that such an integrated facility will have
	less cost, time and will be more plausible since it makes economic use
	of the shutdown power plant by utilizing its fuel handling facilities
	and local talent and infrastructure.
